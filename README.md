# ðŸ”¢ NumberGuesser

NumberGuesser is a simple game that lets players guess a a number between 0 and 100.

* They have chances to guess right or they lose and the game restarts.
* After each attempt they are told whether their guess was too low or too high. With this
information,they can get closer and closer to the number.
* If they guess right on any of their attempts, they are congratulated with a medal and have the
option to restart the game.

# Back ground to this project
This project was one of the first Android Applications that I had ever made. It was a minor
assignment in my university course, Mobile Applications Development wherein we were taught about
application development for Android using Java in the Android Studio IDE.
